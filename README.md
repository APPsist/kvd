# APPsist Chancellor Visualisation Service (German: Kanzler-Visualisierungs-Dienst)

The KVD reacts to events within the APPsist infrastructure and visualizes background processes.

At the moment, the visualized content is only optimized for full HD resolutions.

As other services of the APPsist project, the KVD is a module for the [Vert.x framework](http://vertx.io/vertx2/) (Version 2.1).
